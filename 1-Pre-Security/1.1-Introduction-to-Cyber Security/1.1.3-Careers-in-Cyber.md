## Cyber Security Career Overview

Cyber security is a strong career choice due to its **high demand**, **competitive salaries**, and the nature of the work, which involves defending organizations against real-world attacks. Professionals are allowed to **legally test and attack systems** in controlled ways to identify weaknesses and improve security.

## Security Analyst

A security analyst is responsible for **monitoring and protecting an organization’s data and systems**. They analyze logs, alerts, and system activity to detect potential threats or policy violations.

When security issues are identified, analysts escalate them to security engineers or incident response teams for preventive or corrective action. They also collaborate with multiple stakeholders across the organization to strengthen overall security.

Security analysts compile **incident reports**, documenting security events, data risks, identified vulnerabilities, and the responses taken.

## Security Engineer

A security engineer designs, implements, and maintains **security controls, networks, and systems** to prevent cyberattacks.

They test and evaluate security measures across applications and infrastructure, monitor systems for weaknesses, and apply updates or patches to mitigate vulnerabilities. Security engineers also identify and deploy new tools and technologies required to maintain a secure environment.

Their role focuses on **building and maintaining security**, rather than continuous alert investigation.

---

## Incident Response Specialist

Incident response specialists focus on **detecting, containing, and mitigating attacks while they are actively occurring**.

They develop and maintain actionable incident response plans and support strong security practices across the organization. During an incident, they work to isolate affected systems and limit damage.

After the incident, they conduct **post-incident analysis and reporting**, using lessons learned to improve future defenses.

---

## Digital Forensics Examiner

A digital forensics examiner investigates **security incidents and cybercrimes** using forensic methods.

They collect digital evidence while following proper **legal and procedural standards** to preserve integrity. Analysis may include storage devices, memory, logs, and system artifacts to reconstruct events and identify attacker actions.

All findings are carefully documented and reported for legal, technical, or organizational use.

---

## Malware Analyst

A malware analyst studies **malicious software** to understand how it operates and what impact it has on systems.

They perform **static analysis** by examining malware code without executing it, often using reverse-engineering techniques. They also conduct **dynamic analysis** by running malware in controlled environments to observe behavior.

Findings are documented and shared to improve detection, prevention, and response strategies.

---

## Penetration Tester

A penetration tester is responsible for **testing systems for security weaknesses** before real attackers can exploit them.

They conduct controlled attacks against networks, applications, and systems, perform security assessments and audits, and evaluate organizational policies. Results are reported with clear recommendations to reduce risk and prevent exploitation.

---

## Red Teamer

A red teamer simulates **real-world adversaries** by attacking an organization from an external or internal perspective.

They emulate threat actors to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access, and attempt to evade detection. Red teams assess security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response capabilities.

Their findings are reported with **actionable insights** to help organizations improve defenses and reduce the risk of real attacks.
